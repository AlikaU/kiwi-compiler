Where to find input files: Project1/TestFiles/Semantic
Where to find rest of documentation: Project1/Documentation/DocumentationAsg3.docx

Compilation / execution instructions: 

1. Open the KiwiCompiler.sln file in Visual Studio 2015

2. Run the driver of the SyntaxAnalyzer project 
	a. The driver runs all test cases
	b. In case you want it, from the PREVIOUS ASSIGNMENT, the program will (optionally) 
		output the derivations for all files in Output/logDerivation.txt 
	c. The program will output symbol tables for all test cases in Output/logTable.txt
	d. The program will output all semantic errors in Output/logSemanticError.txt, 
		but please see the note on error reporting in documentation (docx)
	e. The program will ouput all other errors in Output/logError.txt

3. In case you want to see the derivation, the program will prompt you to either 
	- print derivation to a file (takes a while),
	- print derivation to console (a bit faster), 
	- or to not print it at all.
